This project involves handwriting recognition using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on the digits dataset from scikit-learn. The dataset consists of images of handwritten digits. The SVM model is trained on a subset of the data, and its accuracy is evaluated. The code includes visualization of selected images, prediction of their labels, and assessment of the model's overall accuracy. The project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning in recognizing handwritten digits.
